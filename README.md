# C.A.R.A. â€“ Custom Assistant for Research & Analytics

**C.A.R.A. (Custom Assistant for Research & Analytics)** is a GPT-powered AI chatbot built to assist learners, job seekers, and aspiring data analysts with SQL, Python, and data conceptsâ€”delivered with personality, empathy, and a human touch.  

This project was created by **River McGuffie**, a data science student and warehouse worker who got tired of being rejected and overlooked, and decided to build his own damn AI.

## Why I Built This

Like a lot of people trying to break into data, I hit walls, countless rejections, ghosting, and feeling invisible. I wanted to create a tool that could help others the way I needed help: something practical, supportive, and human.  

I named the assistant **C.A.R.A.** after someone I love, because this project comes from a place of love. Love for her, for data, for people, and for proving your worth when nobody gives you a shot.

## Current Status

This project is a work in progress!  
Iâ€™m learning as I goâ€”from building the backend to wiring the chatbot UIâ€”and documenting everything along the way. If youâ€™re a fellow learner or want to collaborate, feel free to contribute or follow the journey.

Final note ðŸ–¤

This project was built with rage, love, the refusal to let a broken hiring system decide my value, and overall, gratitude. This project is dedicated to Cara.
